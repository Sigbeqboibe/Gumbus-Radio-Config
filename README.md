PLEASE READ THE enclosed radio config manuals and their contained disclaimers IN FULL before attempting to use any materials within the Gumbus Radio Configs! (Ultimate config documentation coming soon!)

These config files are designed to get your BaoFeng UV-5R/UV-5R8W (Classic) or 5RM (Ultimate) up and running as quickly and smoothly as possible. 

If you have not yet installed the config onto your radio, there is an install guide included at the bottom of each of the documentation PDFs.

Included in the folders are config documentation PDFs which give an overview of everything the config does. (Ultimate config documentation coming soon!)

Included in the Classic folder is a general user manual for the UV-5R/8W which should cover any other settings or setup that you may wish to explore.

Included in the Ultimate folder is a user manual which covers the basic user functions of the 5RM.

These configs were designed with simplicity in mind!
