This guide is designed to get your BaoFeng UV-5R or UV-5R8W up and running as quickly and smoothly as possible. 
If you have not yet installed the config onto your radio, there is an install guide included at the bottom of the documentation PDF.
The rest of the documentation serves to show what the config file has been changed to allow the radio to work seamlessly.
Included in the config is a general user manual for the UV-5R/8W which should cover any other settings or setup that you may wish to explore.

At its simplest, once the config is loaded on the radio, you select your preferred channels and the radio just works!
