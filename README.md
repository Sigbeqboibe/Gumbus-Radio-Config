This config file is designed to get your BaoFeng UV-5R or UV-5R8W up and running as quickly and smoothly as possible. 

If you have not yet installed the config onto your radio, there is an install guide included at the bottom of the documentation PDF.

Included in the folder is a config documentation PDF which gives an overview of everything the config does.

Also included in the folder is a general user manual for the UV-5R/8W which should cover any other settings or setup that you may wish to explore.

This config was designed with simplicity in mind, so it can be uploaded to anybody's UV-5R/8W and get them talking over the air without any specialized knowledge (provided they follow FCC radio transmission rules, that is).
